      <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 21 February 2026</p>
      <p>These Terms and Conditions govern your use of NetDebug Toolkit. By using this app, you agree to these terms.</p>

      <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
      <p>NetDebug Toolkit provides network diagnostics features such as ping, traceroute, DNS lookup, port scan, whois lookup (RDAP and IANA WHOIS), LAN scan, and Public IP + Geo/ASN lookup for troubleshooting and learning purposes.</p>

      <h2>2. Acceptable Use</h2>
      <p>You agree to use the app only for lawful and authorized activities. You are responsible for ensuring you have permission to test, scan, or query any host, network, or service.</p>

      <h2>3. User Inputs and Saved Hosts</h2>
      <p>The app allows you to save host names, domains, and IP addresses on your device for convenience. You are responsible for the accuracy and legality of the data you enter and use.</p>

      <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>Some features depend on third-party services. Whois lookups may use RDAP services (including rdap.org) and IANA WHOIS/bootstrap services (including whois.iana.org), and may query referred WHOIS servers returned by those services. Public IP + Geo/ASN lookup uses ipinfo.io to retrieve IP, ASN, ISP, and approximate location details. Your use of these features may also be subject to third-party terms and policies.</p>

      <h2>5. Network Results</h2>
      <p>Diagnostic results are best-effort and may vary based on network conditions, remote systems, firewalls, registry/operator behavior, third-party service availability, and platform limitations. Results should not be treated as guaranteed or complete security assessments.</p>

      <h2>6. No Warranty</h2>
      <p>The app is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including fitness for a particular purpose, availability, or accuracy.</p>

      <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the app developer is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the app or reliance on its output.</p>

      <h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>
      <p>These terms may be updated from time to time. Continued use of the app after updates means you accept the revised terms.</p>

      <h2>9. Contact</h2>
      <p>If you have questions about these terms, contact us at <a href="mailto:apps@developerinsider.co">apps@developerinsider.co</a>.</p>
